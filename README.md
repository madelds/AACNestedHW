Introduction: This is Mini Project 5 ("Augmentive and Alternative Communication Devices"), written by Madel Sibal, Sam Rebelsky, and Catie Baker.

Description: The following submission contains a basic implementation of an Augmentive and Alternative Communication Device (AAC).
AAC contains two main components: AACategory and AACMappings. AACCategory stores the mapping between image locations and the text 
that should be spoken, as well as the name of the category. AACMappings stores the mapping of the images on the home page to AACCategories.

Resources: Oracle Help Center was used in order to figure out basic Java syntax and techniques. In addition, the reading on Augmentative and Alternative Communication Devices was a big help in figuring out the directions and functionality of the code. Lastly, Catie Baker and Sam Rebelsky helped by providing the starter code and by clarifying the instructions of the projects during class respectively. I consulted with Jonathan Wang, Maria Rodriguez, and Chloe Kelly to discuss the implementation of certain procedures.
